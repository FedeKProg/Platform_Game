**GENEREAL DESCRIPTION**
On this project, i'm looking to develop a little platform game, in order to apply the general knowledge studied on the course, like lists and OOP.

**PROJECT STATUS**
The proejct is currently ongoing, and at this point we have the levels created, differents forms working in order to change and select differents aspects of the game(sound, levels).
The next step of the project will be to add bullets on it, so the player can shoot them and be able to kill the enemies. Also, i'm looking for to apply Sqlite on the project in order to sabe the highscore reached by the player.

**ENVIRONMENT**
The project is being developed on VSC, with the pygame library, and the interaction os several files, in order to have a more easy going code. 

**INSTALLATION**
In order to instal the game, you have to download the files of the repositores on the same folder(you can find them on the repository). As the files used, are with the relative path of location, you are not required to edit them on the code in order to succesfully run the code. 

**TECHNOLOGIES**
We have used the pygame library of python, and take advantage of the sprite classes, and the sprites groups in order to create the enemis, and differents items on the levels. You can get more information on the following links:
    *https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/sprite.html

**CONTRIBUTION**
You can proceed on helping me on this project, by dowloading the files, and helping me on completing the next steps of the project(detiles on PROJECT STATUS). You can contact me via email, so we can work together in order to be able to get this proejct completed. All help provided is really appreciated with my whole heart

**BUGS OR CORRECTIONS**
As far as i can notice, the only bug, is to be able to make more accurate the hitbox and collitons of the player and items of the level, in order to have a more accorate collision. And also, the player movement can be improved.
